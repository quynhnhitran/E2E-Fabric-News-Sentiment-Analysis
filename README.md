# E2E-Fabric-News-Sentiment-Analysis

## üéØ Project Objective

The **Fabric News Sentiment Analysis** project is an end-to-end solution for real-time news sentiment analysis, built entirely on the **Microsoft Fabric** platform. This solution automatically ingests news articles from the **Bing API**, processes them, performs sentiment analysis (positive, negative), visualizes the results via **Power BI**, and triggers real-time alerts.

This solution demonstrates the capability to build modern data pipelines, utilizing a **Lakehouse** as the central hub, and deploying large-scale **Data Science** models, all within a unified, integrated environment.

The solution architecture follows a modern Lakehouse pattern, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and high performance. The detailed workflow is outlined below.

### Workflow Details

* **Ingestion & Staging**:
    * `news-ingestion-pipeline` calls the **Web Activity** to connect with the **Bing API**.
    * Raw data (JSON) is loaded into the `bing_lake_db` (Lakehouse), initiating the **Delta Lake (Bronze layer)** architecture.
* **Transformation (Synapse DE)**:
    * `process_bing_news` (Notebook) reads raw data from the Lakehouse, cleans it, and writes it to the **Processed/Silver** area.
* **Modeling (Synapse DS)**:
    * `new-sentiment-analysis` (Notebook) reads the clean data, applies a **Text Classification** model, and writes the final results (**Sentiment Score**) to the **Curated/Gold** area.
* **Reporting & BI**:
    * `news-dashboard-dataset` (Semantic Model) is created based on Gold data, using **Direct Lake** mode to provide high-performance querying for the `news-dashboard` (Power BI Report).
    * `bing_lake_db SQL analytics endpoint` provides the capability to query Delta tables directly using **T-SQL**.
* **Real-time Actions**:
    * Two **Activator Items** (`positive sentiment item` and `negative sentiment item`) continuously monitor new data in the Lakehouse (Gold layer) to trigger immediate alerts (**Reflex**) when critical events occur.
